Change case
~    : Changes the case of current character

guu  : Change current line from upper to lower.

gUU  : Change current LINE from lower to upper.

guw  : Change to end of current WORD from upper to lower.

guaw : Change all of current WORD to lower.

gUw  : Change to end of current WORD from lower to upper.

gUaw : Change all of current WORD to upper.

g~~  : Invert case to entire line

g~w  : Invert case to current WORD

guG : Change to lowercase until the end of document.

3~
Toggle case of the next three characters.
g~3w
Toggle case of the next three words.
g~iw
Toggle case of the current word (inner word – cursor anywhere in word).
g~$
Toggle case of all characters to end of line.
g~~
Toggle case of the current line (same as V~).
The above uses ~ to toggle case. In each example, you can replace ~ with u to convert to lowercase,
or with U to convert to uppercase. For example:

U
Uppercase the visually-selected text.
First press v or V then move to select text.
If you don't select text, pressing U will undo all changes to the current line.
gUU
Change the current line to uppercase (same as VU).
gUiw
Change current word to uppercase.
u
Lowercase the visually-selected text.
If you don't select text, pressing u will undo the last change.
guu
Change the current line to lowercase (same as Vu).
